This is my personal ubuntu configuration repo on **WSL**. Remember put local repo under *~/Document/*.

Containing:
- VIM config
  - .vimrc
- source list
- More to go...

Warning: WSL branch doesn't have the software need GUI, like Sublime Text 3 and VS Code.

### vim
- .vimrc:
  - */home/username/.vimrc*, or *~/.vimrc*
  - */root/.vimrc*
  - As for Plugins, Vundle should be installed manually, then use Vundle to install and manage plugins. See [Vundle_README](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim/blob/master/README_ZH_CN.md)

### source list
- source list is sorted by Ubuntu version. Put *sources.list* under */etc/apt/*
